Shostak\n\nRe: CAMEL Team Perspective on Spring Resort\n\nThis provides the CAMEL Brand Team's (Agency /MDD/Media/Promotion/\nBrand) perspective on the 1983 CAMEL Spring Resort program and\nrecommendations for the 1984 Spring Resort program.\n\nIn summary, the Brand Team feels strongly that the Spring Resort\nprogram is on strategy and should remain an integral part of the\nCAMEL promotion program. However, to better achieve the Brand's\nobjective of becoming the brand for younger adult smokers, modifi-\ncations to the 1983 Spring Resort strategies and tactics are recom-\nmended.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe 1983 Spring Resort program was conducted in 10 markets with\nmajor \u2018activities in Daytona Beach, Ft. Lauderdale and Padre Island.\n\n\u201cThe program began in early March and ran for approximately four\n\nweeks.\n\nActivities conducted in the three key markets included sampling,\nextensive field marketing, retail presence and special media.\n\nThe remaining seven markets received sampling and "

During its first seven months in market, BRIGHT has\ngenerated high levels of consumer awareness and trial as well as an\nimportant following of occasional and part-time users. Due to the unique\nnature of this brand, and the fact that many smokers find it \u201cgood for a\nchange\", it seems to be well suited to vending. As emokers often do not\nfind their regular brand in machines and are encouraged to try something\nnew, BRIGHT's part-time usage could potentially be enhanced by vending\ndistribution in strong markets.\n\nThe Buffalo, NY area has been selected for this test because of the strong\nperformance of both BRIGHT styles (combined "

Background - Recent data on carboxyhemoglobin (% COHb), breath carbon monoxide (CO), and nicotine\nconcentrations in smokers smoking EW products over a 7 day period have shown promising results. The two\nEW % COHB studies previously approved by the HRRC committee have clearly shown that smokers of these\nproducts show no significant increase in their % COHb nor their blood nicotine concentrations when compared\nwith their usual brand. These previous studies utilized a Camel Light blend and a CT-6B blend fitted with a\ncarbon scrubber filter.\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to obtain approval for human testing that will measure \"peak-state\" % COHb,\nbreath CO, and nicotine concentrations of FFLT smokers, using the subject's usual brand of cigarette and two\nEW prototyp"

The two prototypes will contain CT-25 light blend tobacco fitted with a carbon scrubber filter.\nOne prototype will contain potassium carbonate (0.5%) and the other no potassium carbonate. The carbon\nscrubber filter removes various mainstream vapor phase components which contribute to negative smoker\nperception attributes (irritation, etc.), providing a \"smoother\" smoking experience. The purpose of the\npotassium carbonate is to replace some of the mouth cues that the carbon scrubber filter removes. The effect of\nthis particular blend on % COHb, breath CO, and nicotine concentrations after an extended period of exclusive\nproduct smoking (7 days) is to be determined.\n\nB.

Our ads showing cowboys riding, roping and camping truthfully depict activities in the\nAmerican West. As you may know, we use real cowboys, not professional models, in our\n\nMARLBORO ads. These men know and appreciate horses - not as beasts of burden but as sensitive\npartners with individual personalities.\n\nWe are committed to taking steps to ensure that everyone involved in the production of MARLBORO\nadvertising goes to great lengths to make certain that the animals will not be harmed during a\nphotography session. !n many instances, the horses used in our ads belong to the cowboys who\nwork with us.

Considerable attention is currently focused on ETS because of\nreports (1, 2) concluding that long term exposure to ETS is associated with\ndisease. However, these conclusions come from epidemiological studies lacking\nvalidated measures of ETS exposure. In response to this deficiency, researchers\nthroughout the world are analyzing indoor air to assess ETS exposure in field\nsettings.

Nicotine and respirable suspended particles (RSP) have found the\ngreatest use as surrogate indicators of ETS exposure; nevertheless, until fairly\nrecently, few investigations involved measurements of both indicators. Against\nthis background, some have attempted to evaluate or predict concentrations of\nnicotine or RSP by assuming that defined ratios of the two substances exist.\nUsing nicotine and RSP data from field surveys, we show here that the\nrelationship between the two is too weak for purposes of either evaluation or\nprediction.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nData are from surveys performed in three public, environmental categories:\noffices (3, 4), restaurants (3, 5), and passenger cabins of commercial aircraft\n(6).

One of the terms used in this calculation is the\npuff number, since we need to know firstly the total volume\nof vapour phase delivered, which is puff number x puff volume\n(35c,c.) x number of cigarettes smoked. In fact the other\ntezms in the calculation referred to are fairly constant and\nthus we can say that delivery at any particular concentration\ndepends on puff number.\n\nThus, if we compare, say, Pall Mall Superlongs with\nMarlboro\u2019, both with a carbon monoxide concentration of 4.1%\nbut deliveries of 18.5mg and 13.7mg. re"

To make the comparison for two Eclipse products, | assumed\nthe SD of the difference would be about 15% greater, which is about the\ndifference in the Eclipse SD vs the UB SD.\n\nThe indicated values are the difference in the observed sample means that are\nrequired for a difference.

I'm director of\nexternal communications for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. With me is Dr. Chris Coggins, a\ntoxicologist with our company.\n\nThis morning we would like to begin a process that is long overdue. We want to bring some\nbalance to the debate surrounding second-hand smoke and other issues concerning cigarettes. And\nwe'd like to establish an open dialogue where members of the media and the public can better\n\nunderstand both sides of the issue.\nDuring the past couple of years there have been a lot of misconceptions about second-hand\n\nsmoke -- including claims that exposure to second-hand smoke is more dangerous than active\nsmoking. But, as Dr. Coggins will detail in just a minute, studies show that second-hand smoke is\nhighly diluted -- and, on average, people are exposed to very small quantities of second-"

We also believe it's time to understand that various efforts to totally ban smoking in public\nplaces, including workplaces, are part of a broader effort to prohibit smoking in the United States.\n\nAs Reynolds Tobacco's chairman told Congress last month ... the real issue is this: \"Should\ncigarettes be outlawed?\" Let's make no mistake about it. The goal of the anti-smoking industry is to\nbriey \u00bback prohibition. \u2018When confronted, they will telf you they don't want prohibition.

And consider this -- alcohol prohibition started with the anti-alcohol movement claiming that\n\ntheir goal was simply \"temperance.\"\n\nTHE EPA REPORT IS BASED ON FAULTY SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS\n\nAs you'll hear from Dr. Coggins ... the current efforts to prohibit smoking are based on a\nfaulty analysis of the science by the EPA. And they fly in the face of what most Americans say they\nwant. Surveys consistently show that Americans overwhelmingly oppose prohibition -- especially\nwhen it's imposed by the government.

Washington\nSubject: Minutes of Stable Menthol Meeting - 4/18/91\n\nHoward Maxwell graphically demonstrated the major problem in the application of poly-MIC\nfrom solution. The material is extremely hydrophobic and the poly-MIC/water combination\nseparates into two totally immiscible phases. Gus Keritsis suggested that it may be possible to\nproduce an emulsion of poly-MIC in a suitable carrier, without the addition of exotic wetting\nagents. Howard then announced that Flavor Development had been successful in defining a\nsolvent for poly-MIC! Poly-MIC can be dissolved (50%) in a mixture (48%/52%) of Methyl\nLinoleate and Methyl Linolinate. The solution can then be further \"thinned\" with benzyl\nalcohol and SD-4. Howard will run some tests on applying poly-MIC in solution to tobacco\nand hopes to have some results by 4/25.\n\nGus Keritsis suggested that a possible solu"

Tobacco was pre-wetted with a 1% pectin solution (50 g of solution/250 g of tobacco),\n\nwe \u201cteamed with poly-MIC powder (5 grams) and sprayed. with an additional 50 grams of the\n\nroa \u00abee pectin solution.

Modifications to the equipment have produced higher feed rates, and\ncigarettes will be made as soon as maker time can be scheduled in the SemiWorks.\n\n3. Electrostatic application of powder to the wrapper just prior to the garniture is being\nconsidered, and tests will be run shortly by an outside contractor. The two caveats in this\nparticular technique are maximum paper speed and the fact that the paper makes a sharp right\nangle turn shortly after the application point.\n\n4.

RCC is manifested in either a\nsporadicMamilial form. As expected, the inherited form appears at a younger age with bilateral,\nmultifocal tumors, which are primarily of the clear cell, non-papillary type. As a result of the\nunusual clinical manifestations, RCC is not diagnosed until it reaches a progressive\ndevelopmental stage. By this time, the tumors are unresponsive to chemo and radiation therapy,\nwith death occurring within one year of diagnosis. RCC also occurs in about 30% of patients with\nvon Hippel-Lindau syndrome, with 15% dying from metastatic RCC.

A significant increase in\nRCC has also been detected in patients with end stage renal disease in which it is the ultimate\ncause of death in many cases.\n\nCytogenetic and molecutar studies of familial and sporadic RCC tumors show that specific\nregions of the genome play a role in tha pathogenesis of RCC. Our lab has focused on one of the\ncritical regions of the genome which is altered as a result of a chromosome translocation,\nt(3;8)(p14.2;q24.1). This rearrangement is found in all members of a family who acquire ROC\nearly in their 30's. The translocation results from rearrangement of the 8q24.1 te 8q terminal\nregion onto chromosome 3 at 3p14.2 (derivative 3)with the 3p14.2 to 3pterminal region\ntranslocating onto 8q at q24.1(derivative 8).

The Drosophila Single-Minded gene product\nis a bHLH factor that acts as a master regulator of midline cell development in the central nervous\nsystem. Along the same lines, the rat homologue of Drosophila Achaete-Scute, MASH-1, is\nexpressed in specific areas of the developing nervous system at the time when neurons are being\ngenerated and many neurons fail to form in homozygous MASH-1 mutant mice (2).

Mutations in another bHLH gene, Enhancer of Split, result in\nhyperplasia of the neurons and the failure of neurons to segregate from the epidermal cells. In\nmammals, the family of myogenic bHLH factors arc well characterized and have been shown to\ninduce cells to differentiate into muscle cells in tissue culture. In in cells in culture and in Xenopus\nembryos, ectopic expression of MyoD leads to the activation of muscle specific genes (3). Several\nother important bHLH genes have also been described.\n\nWe recently cloned cDNAs corresponding to the Xenopus E-box binding proteins (XEs), XE1\nand XE2, Their genes are highly expressed in neurons at the time of neuronal differentiation.

Because of the strong homology of XE! and XE2 with transcription\nfactors essential for cell determination and differentiation in the nervous system in Drosophila, and\nbecause of the striking expression pattern of XEs in areas of the nervous system where neuronal\ndifferentiation occurs: it is likely that XEs play an important role in the development of the nervous\nsystem.

This\nresearch was predominately concerned with collection of analytical data\nto evaluate the circulation and mixing of air and sidestream smoke at\nvarious locations within the chambers.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nA.\n\nTest Facility\n\nThe facility for the Psychophysical (sensory) evaluation of\nEnvironmental Tobacco Smoke (PETS) consists of three chambers.\nEach chamber has dimensions of approximately 8 ft. by 10 ft. by\n8 ft. and a volume of 840 cubic feet (2.44 mx 3.05 m x 2.44 m,\n\n3\n\nvolume = 18.25 cubic meters).

The cigarette companies do promote their products very\nwell. In return, I am well paid to display their signage and displays. This ban\nwould put millions of people on the unemployment line.

N' iodo-\nmethylation occurs regioselectively cis to the pyridine ring for\nall compounds examined. The N/N' and Nt._/ N3 ratios for the\n\ncis trans\nnicotinoids were evaluated with regard to (1) the orientation of\n\nthe N'-methyl group in the free base; (2) conformational properties\n\nof the pyridine ring with respect to the pyrrolidine ring; and\n(3) steric hindrance, and buttressing effects on the pyridine\nnitrogen.

The projected 1988 year-end inventory for that estimate\nwas $36MM raw material and $9MM finished goods. Recently, two additional\nprojections were received; i.e. 1) a write-off of $7.7MM for obsolete fuel\nsource raw material and, 2) a reduction in purchases and, thus, raw material\ninventory of $3.5MM. If those two actions were taken together, the attached\nshows reduce projected LIFO expense of $10.2MM, or, $31.8MM expense for 1988.\n\nToday I contacted Ron Radtke and recommended he use our current annual\nprojection of $31.8MM expense.

Key findings The rate of uptake of ProjectSTOP in\nQueensland compared with Victoria differed significantly; 1 year after roll-out, 72% of pharmacies in\nQueensland had used the system compared with 41% in Victoria. There were significant differences in\ntransaction rates between Queensland and Victoria; the transaction rate in Queensland was four times\ngreater than Victoria | year after roll-out.

Such advertising and promotion, they\ncharge, is designed to recruit new smokers from the ranks of \"the\nyoung, the uneducated and vulnerable population groups at home\n\nand abroad who need to be protected.\"\n\nfe) Following the failure in 1985 of the American Medical\nAssociation-sponsored total advertising and promotion ban\nproposal, anti-smoking advocates, led by Representatives Mike\nSynar (D-OK) and Tom Luken (D-OH), took a somewhat different\ntrack in 1989 by proposing advertising content control\n\nlegislation.\n\nNote: items footnoted with a \"1\" indicate items that have been\nadded since last year\u2019s plan; items footnoted with a \"2\" indicate\nitems that have been significantly expa"

This report was\ndeveloped over the last year based on input from four groups: PM Brand, PM Direct and Database,\nLBCo. Client Service and LBCo. Database. The new report provides more thorough and complete\nTesults for our direct programs. New measures include redemption rates and promoted volume by\ncoupon type. The report also compares response and volume for all programs from the last two\nyears.\n\nIn the future we hope to add coupon redemption curves to this report. These coupon redemption\ncurves are reported on for other brands; however, CMS does not currently provide weekly data for\nMultibrand. We are requesting this data from CMS and will add it "

Differences in source of name,\nsample composition/size are influencing factors.\n\nHowever, the more accruate test mailing which already is in the initial\nstages of production will better address the wisdom of potentially\nreplacing WINSTON with CAMEL among these 2 groups.\n\nResults will be available late August. The next initial mailing also\ntakes place in August (the earliest window to potentially replace WINSTON\nwith CAMEL).\n\nTo ensure the opportunity remains open for CAMEL, we plan to delay that\nportion of the August mailing on WINSTON to late September only among the\nsmoker subgroups in question.\n\n"
